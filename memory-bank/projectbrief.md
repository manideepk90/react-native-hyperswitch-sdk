# Project Brief: RNHyperSwitch

RNHyperSwitch is a React Native SDK that provides a seamless integration for the HyperSwitch payment gateway. It is designed to be consumed by React Native applications to handle payment flows natively.

## Core Components
- **HyperSwitchSDK**: The core React Native library (Android/iOS) that wraps the native payment logic.
- **Demo App**: An example application (`demo-app`) demonstrating the usage of the SDK.

## Goals
- Provide a unified JavaScript/TypeScript API for HyperSwitch payments.
- Ensure high performance and native look-and-feel using React Native's New Architecture (TurboModules, Fabric).
- Simplify the integration process for developers.
